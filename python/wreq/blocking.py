    """

    headers: ClientHeaders | Mapping[str, str] | HeaderMap | None
    r"""
    Get or set the default headers sent with every request.

    Reading gives back a `ClientHeaders`, a `HeaderMap` bound to this client: mutating
    it, with `update()` for instance, applies the change to the requests made
    afterwards.

    Assigning rebuilds the client with the given headers, keeping the rest of its
    configuration and its cookie jar, so the previously set headers are dropped while
    the ones coming from the emulation are kept.

    Examples:

    ```python
    import wreq

    client = wreq.blocking.Client(headers={"x-api-key": "secret"})
    client.headers.update({"x-request-id": "1"})
    client.headers = {"x-api-key": "other"}
    ```
    """

    proxies: Proxy | Sequence[Proxy] | None
    r"""
    Get or set the proxies used by this client.

    A single `Proxy` or a sequence of them can be assigned; reading the attribute
    always gives back a list, or `None` when the client has no proxies.

    Assigning a new value rebuilds the client with the given proxies, keeping the rest
    of its configuration and its cookie jar. Requests made afterwards go through the
    new proxies, while the ones already in flight keep using the previous ones.
    Assigning `None` restores the default behaviour of using the system proxies.

    Note that a client created with `no_proxy=True` never uses a proxy, exactly like
    when both options are given to the constructor.

    Examples:

    ```python
    import wreq

    client = wreq.blocking.Client(proxies=[wreq.Proxy.all("http://proxy.example.com:8080")])
    client.proxies = wreq.Proxy.all("http://other.example.com:8080")
