An ergonomic and modular Python HTTP Client for high-fidelity protocol matching, featuring customizable TLS, JA3/JA4, and HTTP/2 signature capabilities, powered by [wreq](https://github.com/0x676e67/wreq).

## Features

- Async and Blocking `Client`s
- Plain bodies, JSON, urlencoded, multipart
- HTTP Trailer
- Cookie Store
- Redirect Policy
- Original Header
- Rotating Proxies
- Connection Pooling
- Streaming Transfers
- Zero-Copy Transfers
- WebSocket Upgrade
- HTTPS via BoringSSL
- Free-Threaded Safety
- Automatic Decompression
- Certificate Store (CAs & mTLS)


## Why wreq?


1. When your **HTTP** requests succeed in a browser but get blocked in Python due to network fingerprint issues, this tool bridges the gap. [wreq] allows you to customize your **TLS**, **JA3/JA4**, and **HTTP/2** fingerprints to mimic real browsers, making it ideal for web scraping, penetration testing, and security research.

2. The standard **HTTP Client**, such as [requests] and [httpx], have different network fingerprints from browsers. The main differences lie in **TLS handshake**, **HTTP/2 frame characteristics**, and **JA3/JA4** fingerprints. Browsers use specific encryption suites and extensions in the TLS handshake, while standard HTTP clients may use different default settings, causing servers to recognize and block these requests.

3. [wreq] uses the **BoringSSL** library, which is fully sufficient to set TLS fingerprints that match mainstream browsers while maintaining native performance.

4. In addition, the basic functions of [wreq] are similar to those of the standard **HTTP Client**, offering a wide range of features such as connection pooling, redirection policies, Cookie storage, and streaming transmission, which can meet various complex HTTP request requirements.


## Behavior

1. **HTTP/2 over TLS**

Due to the complexity of **TLS** encryption and the widespread adoption of **HTTP/2**, browser fingerprints such as **JA3**, **JA4**, and **Akamai** cannot be reliably emulated using simple fingerprint strings. Instead of parsing and emulating these string-based fingerprints, [wreq] provides fine-grained control over **TLS** and **HTTP/2** extensions and settings for precise browser behavior emulation.

2. **Device Emulation**

**TLS** and **HTTP/2** fingerprints are often identical across various browser models because these underlying protocols evolve slower than browser release cycles. **100+ browser device emulation profiles** are maintained in **[wreq]**.
